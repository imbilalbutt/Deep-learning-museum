# Museum of Deep learning!

![Source](https://ch.mathworks.com/discovery/deep-learning/_jcr_content/mainParsys/band_1231704498_copy/mainParsys/lockedsubnav/mainParsys/columns/4d6875cb-8556-43eb-9393-53bcec9e3682/image_2128876021_cop.adapt.full.medium.svg/1726854001233.svg)

The museum of deep learning is divided into different folders (listed below). Each folder is independent of other. I completed these projects during:
- Bachelors in Computer Science, National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES-FAST), Pakistan
- Masters in Data Science, Friedrich Alexander University (FAU) Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, Germany
- Coursera and other online educational website


## Description of Repository
Deep learning is relatively new technique used in Data science to create deep neural network models to automatically extract feature representation(s). In this repository I have created a lot of different projects based on **Machine learning and Deep learning**. 




## Exploration of repository 

-  [Advance Deep learning](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Advance_Deep_Learning) 
This repository contain implementations of advance topics of deep learning:
   - Expanabale Machile learning (xML) algorithm like LIME and SHAPLEY, 
   - Sequence modellig (like Transformer architecture) and,
   - Generative modelling (like GANs).

- [Coursera Deep learning Specialization deeplearning.ai](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Coursera_Deep_learning_specialization)
This subdir contains all the assignment projects of Deep learning specialization in Coursera offered by Prof. Dr. Andrew Ng of Standford. In this detailed repository you will find all the projects started from foundation building of Neural network using Numpy to Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One interesting example of CNN you will find is about Neural image style transfer.

- [Deep learning Fundamentals](.)
In this subdir you will find things as basic from building of Feed forward neural network (FFNN), CNNs, and RNNs to implementation of ResNet project in Pytorch.

- [Natural Language Processing](.)

- [Standalone Jupyter Notebook Projects](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Mini%20Projects)
This subdir contains all simple projects in jupyter notebooks. It also contains a report and analysis which also explain different concepts. Like you will find Topic Classification using Keras.
