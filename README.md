## Description of Repository
Deep learning is relatively new technique used in Data science to create models to extract feature representation(s).  In this repository I have created a lot of different projects based on **Machine learning and Deep learning**. 



## Repository subdir
-  [Advance Deep learning](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Advance_Deep_Learning) 
This repository contain implementations of advance topics of deep learning ie. Expanabale Machile learning (xML) algorithm like LIME and SHAPLEY, Sequence modellig (like Transformer architecture) and Generative modelling (like GANs).

- [Coursera Deep learning Specialization deeplearning.ai](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Coursera_Deep_learning_specialization)
This subdir contains all the assignment projects of Deep learning specialization in Coursera offered by Prof. Dr. Andrew Ng of Standford. In this detailed repository you will find all the projects started from foundation building of Neural network using Numpy to Convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One interesting example of CNN you will find is about Neural image style transfer.

- [Deep learning Fundamentals]()
In this subdir you will find two things. One is about basic building of Feed forward neural network (FFNN), CNNs, and RNNs. You will also find a project in Pytorch.

- [Natural Language Processing]()

- [Standalone Jupyter Notebook Projects](https://github.com/imbilalbutt/Deep-learning-museum/tree/master/Mini%20Projects)
This subdir contains all simple projects in jupyter notebooks. It also contains a report and analysis which also explain different concepts. Like you will find Topic Classification using Keras.
