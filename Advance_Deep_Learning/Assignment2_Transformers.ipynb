    "In the lecture, transformers have been studied in the context of sequence-to-sequence modelling applications like natural language processing (NLP). Their superior performance to LSTM-based Recurrant neural network gained them a powerful reputation, thanks to their ability to model long sequences. A couple of years ago, transformers have been adapted to the [visual domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) and suprisingly demonstrated better performance compared to the long standing convolutional neural networks conditioned to large-scale datasets. Thanks to their ability to capture global semantic relationships in an image, unlike, CNNs which capture local information within the vicinty of the convolutional kernel window.\n",

To this end, an image patch with dimension *d* is linearly mapped to three vectors; query **q**, key **k**, and value **v** , hence a distint linear layer should be instantiated to get each of the three vectors. To quantify attention for a single patch, first, the dot product is computed between its **q** and all of the **k** vectors and divide by the square root of the vector dimension i.e. *d* = 8. The result is passed through a softmax layer to get *attention features* and finally multiple with **v** vectors associated with each of the **k** vectors and sum up to get the result. This allows to get an attention vector for each patch by measuring its similarity with other patches.\n",

In our case, let **N** = 2, hence, we have 2 sub-vectors, each of length 4. The first sub-vector is processed by the first head and the second sub-vector is process by the second head, each head has distinct Q,K, and V mapping functions of size 4x4. \n",
